Welcome to TheHive wiki!

## Hardware pre-requisites

TheHive uses ElasticSearch to store data. Both software use Java VM. We recommend using a virtual machine with 8vCPU, 8 GB of RAM and 60 GB of disk. You can also use a physical machine with similar specifications.

## Installation guides

### Using docker

TheHive can be run using docker. Follow [this guide](docker-guide) to use it.

### Using binaries

If you want to use binaries instead of a docker, please follow the steps outlined in the [Installation guide](Installation-guide) for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

### Building from sources
If you'd rather build TheHive from the sources, a [step-by-step guide](Build-guide) is available.
